                <h2><br>I- My School Life Prior to Departure</h2>
                <p>Until August 2021, I adhered to the French curriculum within the confines of a traditional classroom setting. My four years of “collège” (middle school + one year of high school) were spent at “Collège Saint-Yves” in Tréguier, in Brittany, France. At the end of this period, I sat for the DNB (Diplôme National du Brevet) exam, which is equivalent to the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education), and I achieved honors in this examination.</p>
                <p>During those four years, my coursework encompassed a wide range of subjects including mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology, French, English, Spanish, history, geography, civics, physical education, music, and art. Additionally, starting from the second year, I began studying Latin, an optional subject. I consistently ranked among the top students in my class.</p>

                <h2><br>II- My School Life until French Baccalauréat</h2>
                <p>In August 2021, my family and I embarked on a sailing journey around the world, leaving behind the traditional classroom setting. Faced with the challenge of continuing my education while sailing the high seas, I looked for alternative options. Through collaboration with a private school called “Cours Pi”, I transitioned to a homeschooling approach that allowed me to remain aligned with the French curriculum, although with some adjustments.</p>
                <p>Over the course of two school years, I continued studying mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology, French, English, history, geography, and civics. Additionally, I opted for three elective courses: advanced math, engineering sciences, and computer sciences. However, due to the unique circumstances of our travels, we decided to forgo formal instruction in music and art.</p>
                <p>Despite the unconventional nature of my learning environment, I remained constant in my academic pursuits. In preparation for the “épreuves anticipées de français du baccalauréat” (anticipated French baccalauréat exams), I dedicated myself to rigorous study and preparation. These exams, which correspond to the language component of the high school diploma, presented a significant challenge, particularly given the remote location where I took them… Tahiti.</p>
                <p>I am proud to share that my efforts produced honorable results. In the oral component of the exams, I achieved a score of 16/20, reflecting my proficiency in spoken French and my ability to articulate ideas effectively. While the written portion posed greater difficulty, I attained a score of 10/20, showcasing my determination to overcome obstacles and perform to the best of my ability under unconventional circumstances.</p>

                <h2><br>III- Current School Life</h2>
                <p>After two years of sailing around the world while following the French curriculum, I made the decision to transfer to Clonlara School. This institution operates under the US educational system, utilizing credits and culminating in a high school diploma. One notable advantage of Clonlara School, aside from its provision for homeschooling, lies in its flexibility regarding elective courses.</p>
                <p>Consequently, I had the opportunity to delve into subjects such as public speaking, sailing yacht design, and a course titled "English for STEM." Additionally, on top of the proficiency level in English I acquired while sailing around the world, the school also recognized my efforts in obtaining my boating license and acquiring proficiency in HTML/CSS for the development of this website.</p>
                <p>During this final year of high school, I actively worked towards obtaining my high school diploma and continue to strive towards this objective.</p>
