        <h1>Volunteering</h1>
        <div class="scrollable-content">
            <p class="intro">With Clonlara School, where volunteering is deeply valued, I've had the opportunity to extend my passion for teaching and helping others. Through volunteering, I've not only taught Wingfoil and sailing to individuals of all ages but also provided math tutoring to middle school students. Additionally, during stopovers, I've continued to engage in community service by helping locals with different tasks. Furthermore, this spirit of service is found in my involvement in maintaining our family boat and contributing to various tasks and watches, during navigation.</p>

                    <p>“I deeply appreciate the Wingfoil advice that you provided me. Your tips helped me progress, especially in optimizing equipment usage, such as hand positioning on the wing's leading edge and foot placement on the board to minimize rolling during takeoff. 
                    <br>Thanks to your guidance, I was able to start "flying" more confidently and to start learning jibes.
                    <br>During these sessions you were able to be patient and precise, which was particularly appreciable as a “student”. You never hesitated to show me yourself the movements that I had difficulty integrating or to bring the board upwind when I drifted too much.
                    <br>To your undeniable qualities as an athlete, we must also add those of a serious and effective teacher.”

                    <p>“Loïck taught us to foil on a Wingfoil board pulled behind a 20 horsepower dinghy. He taught it to us and our three children : Paul, aged 15, Arthur, aged 13 and Nicolas, aged 7.
                        <br>Loïck demonstrated great teaching skills, great patience, knowing when to encourage, when to give indications for progress, or when to let failures sink in. He instinctively knows how to keep children motivated in their learning by valuing each failure as work for future success. He is smiling, attentive, confident and pleasant. We all managed to “fly” a few minutes or a few dozen minutes (depending) on the board.”

                    <p>"Thank you for all the Wingfoil learning and coaching sessions. Before meeting you, I had never tried Wingfoiling. Now, I can confidently say that I've mastered Wingfoiling, whether it's being towed behind a dinghy or using a wing."</p>
