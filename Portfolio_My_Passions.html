            <p>My journey is unique in the way that in August 2021, my family and I set sail to discover the world. From Brittany, we went to Acores, crossed the Atlantic and the Pacific. Eventually, we stayed in French Polynesia for almost a year, and since December 2023, we have been in New-Zealand.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have a profound passion for sports, particularly sailing, which has been a significant part of my life since childhood. From the age of 7 until our departure, I immersed myself in sailing, participating in training sessions and regattas at least twice a week. Initially, I sailed in the Laser Bug class, achieving the title of Brittany Champion and securing 4th place at the French Championship. Later, I transitioned to the Optimist class, where I held the title of Departmental Champion (D3-D2-D1) for a total of 4 years. With the Loguivy club, I engaged in a rigorous national and international program, competing in Spain, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Our team actively participated in various championships, including the France and Belgium Championships, as well as the selection for the World and European Championships. The camaraderie and challenges of club life provided invaluable life lessons.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I teamed up with my father to compete in Weta, a small trimaran. We managed to secure victory at three nationals, with me as the helmsman. While travelling, I independently learned kitesurfing and wing foiling, which I now enjoy at each of our stopovers.</p>
            <p>Naturally inclined towards physical activities, I have explored various sports. While I briefly engaged in activities such as handball, kayaking, ping pong, judo and badminton through different sports clubs, I eventually had to prioritize sailing due to its demanding schedule. During our travels, I collaborated with other teenagers on boats to form a volleyball “team”, engaging in friendly matches with locals in destinations like the Marquesas and Fiji. Beyond that, I am also an avid swimmer (with 5 years of club experience), surfer, runner, mountain biker, diver, and, of course, sailor.</p>                
            <br>
            <p>In academic pursuits, I am drawn to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and computer science. STEM interests me in its logical and practical approach, offering insights into the functioning of the world around us. Consequently, I have dedicated myself to studying STEM subjects every year. Similarly, computer science appeals to me for its logical framework, and I have honed my skills in this field over several years. Notably, I independently developed this website, without relying on website building tools or pre-existing templates, as a testament to my proficiency in coding.</p>
